-The project was to perform live image face recognition into three age groups. 

-Obtained dataset of three age group categories through a research institute and web scrapping.

-Performed Image Augmentation , data pre-processing(Pandas, numpy) and shuffling to fine tune the 
 parameters. 
 
-Used Tensorflow algorithm to train the model with an accuracy of 95%.

-Visualized the data modelling through TensorBoard.
